## jsPsych
jsPsych is a JavaScript library for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser. It provides a framework for defining experiments using a set of flexible plugins that create different kinds of events, and collect different kinds of data. By assembling these plugins together, it is possible to create a wide range of online experiments.

### About Experiment
JsPsych is used to develop a simple task, which is also known as a lexical decision task.

* In the following experiment you will be shown pairs of words and asked to determine whether the word in is a real word (e.g., "group" or "red") or a non-word (e.g., "gork" or "polie").
* The word will appear on the screen for a short time only.
* After that a blank screen will appear for 2700ms.
* It is imperative that you make your decisions as quickly as possible while still preserving the accuracy of you answers.

        ```
        To indicate that a word is a real word, press the "W" key on the keyboard.
        To indicate that a word is a non-word, press the "N" key on the keyboard.
        ```
